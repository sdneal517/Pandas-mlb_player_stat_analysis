mlb_stats_project
In 2018, MLB.com surveyed baseball players about their preferred statistic for evaluating a 
player's ability. The top choices were 'OPS' (On-Base plus Slugging), 'RBI' (Runs Batted In), and 
'R' (Runs Scored).

This code analyzes these stats with three bar graphs, displaying each team's regular-season wins 
(ascending) alongside a top-9 player average of one of these stats. The graphs also include two 
line graphs illustrating all teams' regular-season wins and their respective chosen stat.

The datasets used contain MLB player stats (VIVO VINCO on Kaggle) and win-loss record of each
MLB team, both up to early August of 2023.
