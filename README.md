# MLB Player Stat Analysis

## Introduction

In 2018, MLB.com surveyed baseball players to discover their preferred statistics for evaluating a player's ability. The top choices were 'OPS' (On-Base plus Slugging), 'RBI' (Runs Batted In), and 'R' (Runs Scored).

This code takes a deep dive into these statistics, aiming to provide comprehensive insights. The script creates three visually engaging bar graphs that showcase each team's regular-season wins and compare them to the average of one of these key statistics. Additionally, two line graphs have been crafted to illustrate all teams' regular-season wins and how they correlate with their chosen statistic.

Data sources include MLB player statistics (sourced from VIVO VINCO on Kaggle) and the win-loss records of each MLB team, both up to early August 2023.

## Insights/Takeaways

In the analysis of MLB player statistics and team performance, no consistent correlation was found between a team's win/loss record and the selected statistics ('OPS,' 'RBI,' and 'R'). This highlights the challenge of attributing success in baseball solely to individual player statistics due to the sport's team-oriented nature and complex dynamics.

## Data Sources

The datasets used in this analysis are sourced from the 'VIVO VINCO' dataset available on Kaggle. These datasets provide comprehensive MLB player statistics and the win-loss records of each MLB team. The data is current up to early August 2023.

## Visualizations

This project presents its findings through three bar graphs and two line graphs:

1. **Bar Graphs**:
   - Bar graph 1: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'OPS' statistic for the top-9 players.
   - Bar graph 2: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'RBI' statistic for the top-9 players.
   - Bar graph 3: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'R' statistic for the top-9 players.

2. **Line Graphs**:
   - Line graph 1: Illustrates the regular-season wins of all MLB teams.
   - Line graph 2: Illustrates the regular-season wins of all MLB teams and their respective chosen statistic ('OPS,' 'RBI,' or 'R').

## Conclusion

By analyzing MLB player statistics and correlating them with team performance, this project provides insights into the preferred statistics for evaluating player ability. Whether you're a baseball enthusiast or a data enthusiast, this analysis offers valuable information for understanding the game's dynamics and the metrics that matter most to professional players.
