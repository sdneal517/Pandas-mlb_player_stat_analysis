# mlb_stats_project
#     In 2018, MLB.com surveyed baseball players about their preferred statistic for evaluating a 
# player's ability. The top choices were 'OPS' (On-Base plus Slugging), 'RBI' (Runs Batted In), and 
# 'R' (Runs Scored).
#
#     This code analyzes these stats with three bar graphs, displaying each team's regular-season wins 
# (ascending) alongside a top-9 player average of one of these stats. The graphs also include two 
# line graphs illustrating all teams' regular-season wins and their respective chosen stat.
# 
#     The datasets used contain MLB player stats (VIVO VINCO on Kaggle) and win-loss record of each
# MLB team, both up to early August of 2023.
