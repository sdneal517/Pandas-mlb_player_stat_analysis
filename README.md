# MLB Player Stat Analysis

## Introduction

Baseball enthusiasts often debate which statistics are the best indicators of a player's performance. This project aims to shed light on the preferences of MLB players by conducting an analysis of their preferred statistics. The analysis includes three bar graphs, each displaying the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the top-9 player average for one of the selected statistics ('OPS,' 'RBI,' or 'R').

## Data Sources

The datasets used in this analysis are sourced from the 'VIVO VINCO' dataset available on Kaggle. These datasets provide comprehensive MLB player statistics and the win-loss records of each MLB team. The data is current up to early August 2023.

## Visualizations

This project presents its findings through three bar graphs and two line graphs:

1. **Bar Graphs**:
   - Bar graph 1: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'OPS' statistic for the top-9 players.
   - Bar graph 2: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'RBI' statistic for the top-9 players.
   - Bar graph 3: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'R' statistic for the top-9 players.

2. **Line Graphs**:
   - Line graph 1: Illustrates the regular-season wins of all MLB teams.
   - Line graph 2: Illustrates the regular-season wins of all MLB teams and their respective chosen statistic ('OPS,' 'RBI,' or 'R').

## Conclusion

By analyzing MLB player statistics and correlating them with team performance, this project provides insights into the preferred statistics for evaluating player ability. Whether you're a baseball enthusiast or a data enthusiast, this analysis offers valuable information for understanding the game's dynamics and the metrics that matter most to professional players.
