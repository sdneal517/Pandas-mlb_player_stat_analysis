MLB Player Stat Analysis
This project analyzes MLB player statistics to determine which statistic is most preferred by baseball players for evaluating a player's ability. In 2018, MLB.com conducted a survey among baseball players, and the top three choices for evaluating players were 'OPS' (On-Base plus Slugging), 'RBI' (Runs Batted In), and 'R' (Runs Scored).

Introduction
Baseball enthusiasts often debate which statistics are the best indicators of a player's performance. This project aims to shed light on the preferences of MLB players by conducting an analysis of their preferred statistics. The analysis includes three bar graphs, each displaying the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the top-9 player average for one of the selected statistics ('OPS,' 'RBI,' or 'R').

Data Sources
The datasets used in this analysis are sourced from the 'VIVO VINCO' dataset available on Kaggle. These datasets provide comprehensive MLB player statistics and the win-loss records of each MLB team. The data is current up to early August 2023.

Visualizations
This project presents its findings through three bar graphs and two line graphs:

Bar Graphs:

Bar graph 1: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'OPS' statistic for the top-9 players.
Bar graph 2: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'RBI' statistic for the top-9 players.
Bar graph 3: Displays the regular-season wins of MLB teams in ascending order alongside the average 'R' statistic for the top-9 players.
Line Graphs:

Line graph 1: Illustrates the regular-season wins of all MLB teams.
Line graph 2: Illustrates the regular-season wins of all MLB teams and their respective chosen statistic ('OPS,' 'RBI,' or 'R').
Conclusion
By analyzing MLB player statistics and correlating them with team performance, this project provides insights into the preferred statistics for evaluating player ability. Whether you're a baseball enthusiast or a data enthusiast, this analysis offers valuable information for understanding the game's dynamics and the metrics that matter most to professional players.
